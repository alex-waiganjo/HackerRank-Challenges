# TASK
'''
Complete the code in the editor below. The variables i ,d and s are already declared and initialized for you. You must:

1. Declare 3 variables: one of type int, one of type double, and one of type String.
2. Read 3 lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the Input Format section below) and initialize your 3 variables.
3. Use the  operator to perform the following operations:
     a. Print the sum of i plus your int variable on a new line.
     b. Print the sum of d plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place on a new line.
     c. Concatenate s with the string you read as input and print the result on a new line.

# Sample Input
        #   a. 12
        #   b. 4.0
        #   c. is the best place to learn and practice coding!

# Sample Output
        #   a. 16
        #   b. 8.0
        #   c. HackerRank is the best place to learn and practice coding!    


#Solution
i = 12
d = 4.0
s = 'HackerRank '

i2 = int(input()) # read int
d2 = float(input()) # read double 
s2 = input() # read string

# Declare second integer, double, and String variables.

# Read and save an integer, double, and String to your variables.

# Print the sum of both integer variables on a new line.

# Print the sum of the double variables on a new line.

# Concatenate and print the String variables on a new line
# The 's' variable above should be printed first.
print(i+i2)
print(d2+d2)
print(s+s2)
